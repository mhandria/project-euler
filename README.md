Project Euler's Problems



#1: used arithmetic progression to answer the question
  main formula:
    1/2*n*(a+l) = Sn
  supplementary formula:
    l = ((int)(l/d))*d,
    n = ((l-a)/d)+1

#2: used Bivet's Formula and golden ratio to answer the question
  main formula:
    (Phi^n - (-Phi)^n)/sqrt(5)
  supplementary formula:
    Phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2,
    -Phi = (1 - sqrt(5))/2
